Temporal discretisation

In this section, we discuss how :ref:`the governing equations <governing_equations>` are integrated in time.

In particular, the mass and momentum balances are tightly coupled, which will be discussed in the first part.
The temporal treatment of temperature field is much simpler, which is presented in the second part.

The derivation and the accuracy of the used schemes are shown in the appendix.
